# Project Overviewview 
In this assignment I used skills learned to collect data, organize it, analyze it and create a visualization. I used automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup. 

## Analysis 
Is included in each of the final jupyter notebooks. 

### Instructions to Final Work 
My final work can be found in the following files, "RP.part_1_mars_news.ipynb" and "RP.part_2_mars_news.ipynb". These are both located in the "Starter Code" folder.  
Per the instructions, there is also a json and csv file in the "Starter Code" folder. 

Thank you!
